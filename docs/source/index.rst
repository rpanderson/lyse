lyse
====

**lyse** is a data analysis framework for experiments controlled by the labcsript suite. Analysis routines are Python scripts that can be run on a labscript shot file. We break analysis into two distinct groups:

1. **single-shot analysis** routines analyse a single hdf5 file corresponding to one realisation of an experimental sequence, or *shot*; and
2. **multi-shot analysis** routines perform higher-order analysis on data from many shots.

A set of Python scripts can be loaded for each analysis category, which will run (when appropriate) on new shot files as they are sent to lyse from **blacs**. Acquired data, global variables from **runmanager** and analysis results generated in lyse, for all loaded shots, are stored in a table (a `pandas DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_). This is a powerful analysis schema that takes advantage of the self-documenting nature of labscript experiment shot files.

The DataFrame is displayed in the lyse GUI and can also be accessed remotely from another PC as follows:

.. code-block:: Python

   import lyse
   df = lyse.data(host='127.0.0.1', port=42519)

Moreover, the lyse DataFrame can be serialised so that an analysis session can be restored in lyse or in a headless environment.

The lyse interface, comprising:

- Single- and multi-shot analysis routines (Python scripts);
- A graphical representation of the Pandas DataFrame;
- Figures generated by the analysis scripts.†
- The output log from lyse and the analysis routines.

† In this example, these are publication quality figures generated for the manuscript *Science* **364**, pp. 1267 (2019) `doi:10.1126/science.aat5793 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat5793>`_.


Installation
------------

lyse can be installed on Python 3.6 and later by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install labscript-lyse
